ALEKSEY MARESYEV (1916-2001). Nov. 2017, www.sps-aviation.com/story/ 
     ?id=2160&h=Aleksey-Maresyev-1916-2001. This article provides a more in-depth story of Alexey 
     Maresyev's life. It provides more details to his early life than on any other page we have 
     found. It also provides information as to how he got the idea of becoming a pilot and why he 
     wanted to fly. It tells his story of working through the ranks, first become a Soviet air 
     technician than a pilot. Alexey's fights before his crash are also discussed, as well as his 
     crash and flights after he was successful in returning to flight. The last point made is that 
     after he retired, he became a member of the Supreme Soviet. There, he helped out other veterans 
     and advocated for disabled rights.  
      
     The author of this article is listed with a link to a short biography. The information is free 
     of grammatical errors and typos. The information is up to date and quite comprehensive. The 
     article provides a well-balanced story, discussing many different turning points of the pilot's 
     life. No primary documents are used and there are no links to other sources or sources used. 
      
     We used this article as a way to gather more background information on Alexey Maresyev. This 
     article particularly helped us gain more knowledge of Alexey's childhood, and what his efforts 
     were after the war. 
Aleksey Maresyev with a student from the German Democratic Republic ©. RTNews, 21 May 2017, 
     www.rt.com/news/389109-maresyev-plane-found-documentary/. This is an image of Alexey Maresyev 
     with a student from the German Democratic Republic. Both he and the student are smiling and 
     Alexey looks as if he is holding a wallet of some sort. I presume this photograph was taken in 
     Russia, between 1995 and 2001. This piece is published on RT News and is the only site I have 
     found the image on. The photo was most likely taken to capture the moment and created for 
     people to remember the event.  
      
     The source contains many primary sources, as well as a brief summary of Alexey's life. This 
     information is accurate and up to date, although the news site does not contain any information 
     as to who, when, or where the photograph was taken. 
      
     We used this photo on our websites after the warpage. We used this image when talking about 
     his teachings after he retired from the war. 
Alexey Petrovich Maresyev, Soviet military pilot. Hero of the Soviet Union. ikprf.ru, lkprf.ru/ 
     persons/773.html. Accessed 8 May 2019. This is a photograph of Alexey Maresyev standing next to 
     a plane. The ground is covered in snow. Alexey is dressed as if prepared to board the plane. 
     This photograph was taken in Russia, at around 1942. It is a published photograph on the 
     container website and that is the only place I have seen this image. The photograph was most 
     likely taken to remember this event. An intended audience may have been Alexey himself or other 
     pilots as well. 
      
     The website itself is in Russian, but it's translatable. The details on the bottom of the 
     photograph, however, could not be translated. I am assuming the title of the piece, as well as 
     the author and possibly the date, are on the bottom of the image. The publisher is from the 
     Russian Communist Federation. The website contains a small bio about the pilot. It does not 
     cite information about the photograph or any other primary sources. 
      
     We used this image on the home page of our website. It gives a good visual representation of 
     his time as a Russian pilot. 
Álvaro. Polikarpov l-16-Spain. 6 July 2008. wikipedia, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16#/media/ 
     File:Polikarpov_I-16-Spain_(clipped).jpg. Accessed 26 Apr. 2019. This is a link to a wiki page 
     containing the image of an I-16, the kind of plane Alexey flew and crashed in. This photograph 
     was taken in Russia on May 10th, 2014. The photograph was taken by a Russian wiki user. This 
     plane is currently being displayed in the Memorial Museum of Valery Chkalov, Chkalovsk, Russia. 
     It is a published photograph. The piece was created to show an audience of plane enthusiasts or 
     anyone on the wiki page an example photo of the plane they were reading about. 
      
     Attached to the image in the wiki page are multiple links that contain information about the 
     date the photo was taken, the location of the plane, where the photograph was taken, and the 
     author. The author is, however, only listed as a Russian wiki user. The image seems accurate 
     and matches the information given in the source. 
      
     We used this image on our website to provide a visual of the kind of plane Alexey was flying 
     during the crash. 
Budanovic, Nikola. "The Incredible Fate of the Soviet Fighter Ace, Alexei Maresyev – Hero With No 
     Legs." War History Online, 14 Apr. 2016, www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/ 
     the-incredible-fate-of-the-soviet-fighter-ace-alexei-maresyev.html. This article starts out by 
     discussing Alexey Maresyev throughout his early life. He suffered from joint pain starting at a 
     very young age and because of this, he was thought of as the weak one out of his siblings. It 
     then goes on to discuss his achievements in flight before and after his almost fatal crash. His 
     success with prosthetics, different types of planes, and recovery are all details that are also 
     mentioned.  
      
     There are an author and date of publication listed on this web page. The information is 
     complete, up to date, and free of errors. It presents a well-balanced argument and was 
     published for educational purposes. The article contains primary source photographs and used 
     quotes from the piolet himself.  
      
     We used this article on the greatest achievements page on our website. We used this 
     information specifically about his awards and 86 missions. 
"The feat of a true man: the life of Alexey Maresyev." WeapoNews, 15 Apr. 2017, weaponews.com/ 
     history/4865-the-feat-of-a-true-man-the-life-of-alexey-maresyev.html. This source contains one 
     primary source we used on our website as well as a short summary of the most valid points to 
     Alexey Maresyev's life. The article talks about his childhood, crash, schooling, recovery, and 
     burial. This source also mentions the book written by Boris Polevoy. Unlike other sources we 
     used this article gives more specific details about Alexey's family and life while going 
     through flight school. It also discusses his time as a technician in the military before he 
     began aviation.  
      
     The author is not listed. The cite is free of grammatical and spelling errors. The information 
     is currant and up to date. The information is also very in depth and contains many smaller 
     details that we have not seen anywhere else. It presents a well-balanced story. The source also 
     uses primary sources and links you to other articles that could help develop a more 
     well-rounded story of the wartime.  
      
     We used this source to add smaller key details into our website. It contained details 
     specifical about his family life and time during flight school that we did not see anywhere 
     else, so we thought this was valuable information to use. 
Julia, and Keld. "Alexey Petrovich Maresyev." Find A Grave, 27 Aug. 2011, www.findagrave.com/ 
     memorial/75567712/alexey-petrovich-maresyev. The website gives a brief description of Alexey's 
     life and achievements. It contains information about his plane and burial site. The source also 
     provides a few images of his burial site and of the pilot himself. It also links you to a 
     couple of other sources such as newspaper articles, DNA testing, and military records. 
      
     The text is free of grammatical and spelling errors. An author is listed with a link provided 
     to their bio on the "Find a Grave" website. The information is up to date but does not include 
     a lot of information about his life after the crash. It presents a fair summary of the largest 
     points of Alexey's life. It does use and link you to a variety of different sources. It 
     contains primary sources such as images, news articles, and military rank documents. Some of 
     these are not present directly on the web page but are linked to it. 
      
     We used this source when gathering background information on the pilot. We also used this as a 
     way to find more primary sources to be used on our site.

     an image of Alexey Maresyev after the war. He is wearing a suit from which his star-shaped 
     award is attached. This is a published piece. This photograph was taken to be used as an image

     be used in news articles such as this one. 
      
     The award is titled Hero of the Soviet Union. There is no credit as to where this photograph 
     was taken, but he was given the award in Russia. No specific photographer is listed on

"RT looks into WWII mystery with amateur who found crash site of Soviet hero pilot." RT News, 21 May 
     2017, www.rt.com/news/389109-maresyev-plane-found-documentary/. This source contains two of the 
     primary sources we used. It contains the image of Alexey Maresyev with a student and the 
     documentary. It contains several other images that we did not use as well. The article talks 
     about similar information as the documentary. It discusses the "missing" plane that Alexey 
     crashed in. It also discusses his time as a pilot without both of his legs. The article also 
     contains quotes from people who had to do with the discovery of his "missing" plane.  
      
     There is no author listed. The article is free of grammar and spelling mistakes. The 
     information is current and up to date. It is a sort of advertisement or teaser for the 
     documentary so the information about the recovery of the plane is not as comprehensive as in 
     the documentary. It links you to and cites many primary sources such as interviews, images, and 
     quotes.  
      
     We used this source as a means of gathering primary sources. We used the image of Alexey with 
     the student on our after the war page. We used clips of the documentary as the interview 
     portion of our website. 
     
Skybound. RT Documentaries, 2017. This is a documentary created about Alexey Maresyev. It builds off 
     the book and movie and includes many different scenes from the movie to tell the story. The 
     documentary also includes interviews and stories from people who knew the pilot. These people 
     include his son, former wingman, and the woman who found and rehabilitated him after the crash. 
     The story mostly includes the events after the crash, but also the events surrounding the crash 
     itself. 
      
     The source seemed credible and included a variety of credible primary sources. The information 
     is current, up to date, and does not contain any holes. It presents well balanced ideas and 
     gives many different prespectives to the story. The primary documents include papers dealing 
     with his "lost" plane, articles, reports, quotes, etc. 
      
     We used this source as a means of gather background information and included some of the key 
     details and primary sources in the site. The main way we used this source is to gather our 
     interview clips.
     
Story of a Real Man, an Opera in 4 Acts. Composed by Sergei Prokofiev. YouTube, www.youtube.com/ 
     watch?v=1YDAvypDV8E. Accessed 26 Apr. 2019. Performance. This is a Russian opera composed by 
     Sergei Prokofiev. It was his last opera. It was written between 1947 to 1948 and had its first 
     performance on December 3'rd of 1948. The opera was created in Russia and it was a published 
     piece. His main inspiration was the story of Alexey Maresyev. The opera itself has the same 
     name as the book written about his life by Borris Polevoy. The audience contained mostly Soviet 
     cultural officials who did not find the work satisfactory. This did not come well to the 
     composer because he hoped the opera would rehabilitate his reputation among communist 
     authorities after being previously accused of "formalism". 
      
     When analyzed, this source it is easy to find information about the composer, publication, and 
     backstory. The information, from my perspective, is accurate and the information given to 
     create this citation has been found on multiple websites. The information is all the same and 
     sources credibly within these sites as well. 
      
     We used this source in our website as an added audio experience. It was an interesting 
     artifact and perspective from the experience of Alexey, so we included it in this way.

     rgo.ru, rgo, 3 Mar. 2018, www.rgo.ru/en/article/aleksey-maresyev-lifelong-hero. Accessed 
     25 Apr. 2019. This website provides information about the documentary and book written about 
     Alexey. It gives a brief summary of his heroic acts on the night of April 4'th, 1942. The 
     article also hints at Alexey's "lost" plane and the inaccurate details within the book. The 
     article then closes with a description of the documentary made in 2015. 
      
     The source contains a date and links you to multiple different pages at the top from the same 
     Geographical site. The text is free of grammatical errors. The information is accurate and well 
     developed, though it is kept short. It presents a well-balanced argument and includes many key 
     arguments. Primary sources were not used, although when giving a description of the documentary 
     it states interviews were conducted and photographs were used to tell the story. 
      
     This source was used to gather more background information. The source led us to read the book 
     and watch the documentary. Information from both the book and documentary was included in our 
     website.

His main inspiration was the story of Alexey Maresyev. The opera itself has the same </pre><pre>     name as the book written about his life by Borris Polevoy. The audience contained mostly Soviet </pre><pre>     cultural officials who did not find the work satisfactory. This did not come well to the </pre><pre>     composer because he hoped the opera would rehabilitate his reputation among communist </pre><pre>     authorities after being previously accused of "formalism".&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     When analyzed, this source it is easy to find information about the composer, publication, and </pre><pre>     backstory. The information, from my perspective, is accurate and the information given to </pre><pre>     create this citation has been found on multiple websites. The information is all the same and </pre><pre>     sources credibly within these sites as well.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     We used this source in our website as an added audio experience. It was an interesting </pre><pre>     artifact and perspective from the experience of Alexey, so we included it in this way. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>общество, Русское географическое.
