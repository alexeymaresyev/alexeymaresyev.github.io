Nov. 2017, www.sps-aviation.com/story/ </pre><pre>     ?id=2160&h=Aleksey-Maresyev-1916-2001. This article provides a more in-depth story of Alexey </pre><pre>     Maresyev's life. It provides more details to his early life than on any other page we have </pre><pre>     found. It also provides information as to how he got the idea of becoming a pilot and why he </pre><pre>     wanted to fly. It tells his story of working through the ranks, first become a Soviet air </pre><pre>     technician than a pilot. Alexey's fights before his crash are also discussed, as well as his </pre><pre>     crash and flights after he was successful in returning to flight. The last point made is that </pre><pre>     after he retired, he became a member of the Supreme Soviet. There, he helped out other veterans </pre><pre>     and advocated for disabled rights. &nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     The author of this article is listed with a link to a short biography. The information is free </pre><pre>     of grammatical errors and typos. The information is up to date and quite comprehensive. The </pre><pre>     article provides a well-balanced story, discussing many different turning points of the pilot's </pre><pre>     life. No primary documents are used and there are no links to other sources or sources used.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     We used this article as a way to gather more background information on Alexey Maresyev. This </pre><pre>     article particularly helped us gain more knowledge of Alexey's childhood, and what his efforts </pre><pre>     were after the war. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Aleksey Maresyev with a student from the German Democratic Republic ©</i>. <i>RTNews</i>, 21 May 2017, </pre><pre>     www.rt.com/news/389109-maresyev-plane-found-documentary/. This is an image of Alexey Maresyev </pre><pre>     with a student from the German Democratic Republic. Both he and the student are smiling and </pre><pre>     Alexey looks as if he is holding a wallet of some sort. I presume this photograph was taken in </pre><pre>     Russia, between 1995 and 2001. This piece is published on RT News and is the only site I have </pre><pre>     found the image on. The photo was most likely taken to capture the moment and created for </pre><pre>     people to remember the event. &nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     The source contains many primary sources, as well as a brief summary of Alexey's life. This </pre><pre>     information is accurate and up to date, although the news site does not contain any information </pre><pre>     as to who, when, or where the photograph was taken.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     We used this photo on our websites after the warpage. We used this image when talking about </pre><pre>     his teachings after he retired from the war. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Alexey Petrovich Maresyev, Soviet military pilot. Hero of the Soviet Union.</i> <i>ikprf.ru</i>, lkprf.ru/ </pre><pre>     persons/773.html. Accessed 8 May 2019. This is a photograph of Alexey Maresyev standing next to </pre><pre>     a plane. The ground is covered in snow. Alexey is dressed as if prepared to board the plane. </pre><pre>     This photograph was taken in Russia, at around 1942. It is a published photograph on the </pre><pre>     container website and that is the only place I have seen this image. The photograph was most </pre><pre>     likely taken to remember this event. An intended audience may have been Alexey himself or other </pre><pre>     pilots as well.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     The website itself is in Russian, but it's translatable. The details on the bottom of the </pre><pre>     photograph, however, could not be translated. I am assuming the title of the piece, as well as </pre><pre>     the author and possibly the date, are on the bottom of the image. The publisher is from the </pre><pre>     Russian Communist Federation. The website contains a small bio about the pilot. It does not </pre><pre>     cite information about the photograph or any other primary sources.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     We used this image on the home page of our website. It gives a good visual representation of </pre><pre>     his time as a Russian pilot. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Álvaro. <i>Polikarpov l-16-Spain</i>. 6 July 2008. <i>wikipedia</i>, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16#/media/ </pre><pre>     File:Polikarpov_I-16-Spain_(clipped).jpg. Accessed 26 Apr. 2019. This is a link to a wiki page </pre><pre>     containing the image of an I-16, the kind of plane Alexey flew and crashed in. This photograph </pre><pre>     was taken in Russia on May 10th, 2014. The photograph was taken by a Russian wiki user. This </pre><pre>     plane is currently being displayed in the Memorial Museum of Valery Chkalov, Chkalovsk, Russia. </pre><pre>     It is a published photograph. The piece was created to show an audience of plane enthusiasts or </pre><pre>     anyone on the wiki page an example photo of the plane they were reading about.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     Attached to the image in the wiki page are multiple links that contain information about the </pre><pre>     date the photo was taken, the location of the plane, where the photograph was taken, and the </pre><pre>     author. The author is, however, only listed as a Russian wiki user. The image seems accurate </pre><pre>     and matches the information given in the source.&nbsp;</pre><pre>     &nbsp;</pre><pre>     We used this image on our website to provide a visual of the kind of plane Alexey was flying </pre><pre>     during the crash. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Budanovic, Nikola.

He suffered from joint pain starting at a </pre><pre>     very young age and because of this, he was thought of as the weak one out of his siblings. It </pre><pre>     then goes on to discuss his achievements in flight before and after his almost fatal crash.
