Aleksey Maresyev with a student from the German Democratic Republic ©. RTNews, 21 May 2017, 
<br><br>
www.rt.com/news/389109-maresyev-plane-found-documentary/. This is an image of Alexey Maresyev with a student from the German Democratic Republic. Both he and the student are smiling and Alexey looks as if he is holding a wallet of some sort. I presume this photograph was taken between 1995 and 2001. This photograph was taken in Russia. This piece is published on RT News and is the only site I have found the image on. The photo was most likely taken to capture the moment and created for people to remember the event.
<br><br>
The source does contain many primary sources and a brief summary of Alexey's life. This information is accurate and up to date. However, the news site does not contain any information as to who, when, or where the photograph was taken.
<br><br>
We used this photo on our website's after the war page. We used this image when talking about his teachings after he retired from the war.

Alexey Petrovich Maresyev, Soviet military pilot. Hero of the Soviet Union. ikprf.ru, lkprf.ru/persons/773.html. Accessed 8 May 2019. This is a photograph of Alexey Maresyev standing next to a plane. The ground is covered in snow. Alexey is dressed as if prepared to board the plane. This photograph was taken around 1942 in Russia. It is a published photograph on the container website and that is the only place I have seen this image. The photograph was most likely taken to remember this event. An intended audience may have been Alexey himself or other pilots as well.
<br><br>
The website itself is in Russian, but translatable. The details on the bottom of the photograph, however, could not be translated. I am assuming the title of the piece, as well as the author and possibly the date, are on the bottom of the image. The publisher is a Russian communist Federation. The website contains a small bio about the pilot. It does not cite information about the photograph or any other primary sources.
<br><br>
We used this image on the home page of our website. It gives a good visual representaion of his time as a Russian pilot.

This is a link to a wiki page containing the image of an I-16, the kind of plane Alexey flew and crashed in. This photograph was taken on May 10'th 2014 in Russia. The photograph was taken by a Russian wiki user. This plane is currently being displayed in the Memorial Museum of Valery Chkalov, Chkalovsk, Russia. It is a published photograph. The piece was created to show the audience of plane enthusiasts or anyone on the wiki page an example photo of the plane they were reading about.
<br><br>
Attached to the image in the wiki page are multiple links that contain information about the date the photo was taken, the location of the plane, where the photograph was taken, and the author. The author is however only listed as a Russian wiki user. The image seems accurate and matches the information given in the source.

Story of a Real Man, an Opera in 4 Acts. Composed by Sergei Prokofiev. YouTube, www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YDAvypDV8E. Accessed 26 Apr. 2019. Performance. This is a Russian opera composed by Sergei Prokofiev. It was his last opera. It was written between 1947 to 1948 and had its first performance on December 3'rd of 1948. The opera was created in Russia and it was a published piece. His main inspiration was the story of Alexey Maresyev. The opera itself has the same name as the book written about his life by Borris Polevoy. The audience contained mostly Soviet cultural officials who did not find the work satisfactory. This did not come well to the composer because he hoped the opera would rehabilitate his reputation among communist authorities after being previously accused of "formalism".
<br><br>
When analyzed, this source it is easy to find information about the composer, publication, and backstory.
